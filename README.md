# Master Royale Info
Master Royale was one of Clash Royale's most well-known private servers, it was originally created in 2017, but I joined the team in late 2018 as a Community Manager to help "revive" the game.

I was always eager to learn more about modding and creating custom content for the game, so I spent several months learning and eventually took on the additional role of Game Designer, making a lot of custom content for the game.

Master Royale consisted of two private servers, Master Royale Vanilla, and Master Royale Infinity.

When Master Royale Infinity came out in 2021, the game quickly blew up due to becoming viral on TikTok. While unfortunately a lot of the viral videos and also the official Master Royale account got taken down due to Supercell copyright strikes, there are still lots of clips available to this day which I will be linking in this README file. I will mostly be focusing on that as that has been where most of my game design contributions have been.

My design philosophy for Master Royale Infinity was all about making a game that was chaotic and entertaining, but fair. Different strategies have different counters and there are lots of fun decks players can come up with. This variety allows for the game to feel more balanced than it may appear in videos. This makes it a perfect game for virality, as it's chaotic enough to surprise a viewer watching the game on video, but still engaging and fair to the player.

Master Royale has had millions of unique registered accounts over its lifetime and was able to maintain thousands of concurrent players on average daily!

While Master Royale has had a lot of interesting updates over time, here are some interesting ones I worked on:

- Master Royale Champions Update (Released December 2021):
  - Upgraded the game version Master Royale runs on to support Clash Royale's newest update at the time
  - Upgraded the server architecture to make the game run more stable
  - Added brand new cards from the latest game version (the Champions Skeleton King, Archer Queen, and Golden Knight, and also other cards such as Mother Witch and Electro Giant were modified for Master Royale Infinity in this update)
  - Reset the ladder to allow for all players to have a fair start
  - While the trailer for this update no longer exists on Social Media due to the official Master Royale TikTok account being removed, I uploaded it here: https://streamable.com/0yfi3z

- Master Royale Infinity Goku Update (Released January 2022)
    - Added the first custom Champion card using entirely custom sprites designed by our VFX modding team member.
    - I was responsible for designing the gameplay of the card and also made the custom SFX, which was added in a secondary patch later.
    - This was one of the things that made Master Royale Infinity truly well-known, as even a fair bit of official Supercell content creators reacted to clips of Master Royale Infinity from this time, despite this usually not being allowed by Supercell.

 - Master Royale Vanilla Super Dark Prince Challenge (Released February 2022):
   - This update introduced a special event challenge to Master Royale Vanilla.
   - The challenge was known as the "Super Dark Prince Event", and it featured a custom card designed by me.
   - The base concept for the card was taken from Master Royale Infinity and was tweaked to fit in a balanced environment alongside the regular cards in the game.

- Master Royale Vanilla Pancake Madness Challenge (Released July 2022)
- This update introduced another custom game mode into Master Royale Vanilla.
- This one is based off of the Super Mini PEKKA which was recently added to Clash Royale around this time.
  Details: Every 15 seconds, a giant Pancake Spawns in the middle of the map! Destroy it for a 1/3 chance of:

  - Super Mini PEKKA

  - Invisible Mini PEKKA

  - A Healing Pancake

  Both players will have Super Mini PEKKA in their deck.

  The gamemode also follows Ramp-Up elixir rules, so elixir production will ramp up throughout the match.
